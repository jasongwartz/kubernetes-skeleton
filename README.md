# kubernetes-skeleton
A collection of manifests for my commonly-used Kubernetes applications

This repo contains Kubernetes configurations for things I use in almost every Kubernetes cluster - Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, an ingress controller - as well as some just generally useful tools, like pihole and jupyter.  
Checkout the branch `home-rpi` for versions of these configs that run on a Raspberry Pi armhf cluster (where much of this project started).
